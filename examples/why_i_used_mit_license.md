# Why I Chose the MIT License for LevLang

**By Sriram Ramnath | November 2025**

## TL;DR

I chose the MIT License because **I want LevLang to be used everywhere, by everyone, with no strings attached**. Teachers should be able to use it in classrooms. Companies should be able to build tools on top of it. Students should be able to learn from the source code. No permission needed. No restrictions. Just build.

## The License Decision

When you create open-source software, one of the first decisions you face is: **which license?**

This isn't just a legal formality—it's a philosophical statement about how you want your work to be used, shared, and built upon.

For LevLang, I considered several options:

### Option 1: GPL (GNU General Public License)

**The "copyleft" license**

- **Pro**: Ensures all derivative works remain open source
- **Pro**: Protects against proprietary forks
- **Con**: Restricts commercial use in some scenarios
- **Con**: Can't be integrated into proprietary educational software

**Why I didn't choose it:** While I love the GPL's idealism, I didn't want to restrict how teachers and schools could use LevLang. Many educational institutions use proprietary learning management systems, and GPL would prevent LevLang from being integrated into those environments.

### Option 2: Apache 2.0

**The "patent-friendly" license**

- **Pro**: Includes explicit patent grants
- **Pro**: More protective than MIT
- **Con**: Longer, more complex legal text
- **Con**: Requires attribution in binary distributions

**Why I didn't choose it:** LevLang is an educational tool, not enterprise software. I don't expect patent issues to arise, and the additional complexity didn't seem worth it.

### Option 3: MIT License ✓

**The "do whatever you want" license**

- **Pro**: Incredibly simple and permissive
- **Pro**: Maximum freedom for users
- **Pro**: Widely understood and accepted
- **Pro**: No restrictions on commercial use
- **Pro**: Easy to understand (even for students!)

**This is what I chose.** Here's why.

## The Philosophy Behind MIT

The MIT License can be summarized in one sentence:

> **"Here's the code. Do whatever you want with it. Just keep the copyright notice and don't sue me if something breaks."**

That's it. No complicated clauses. No restrictions. No gotchas.

### Why This Matters for LevLang

LevLang is a **teaching tool**, and teaching requires maximum accessibility. Consider these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: The High School Teacher**

Ms. Johnson wants to use LevLang in her computer science class. She shouldn't need to:
- Understand complex licensing terms
- Get approval from the school's legal department
- Worry about whether she can modify the language for her curriculum
- Stress about whether students can use it in their portfolios

**MIT License = She can just use it.**

**Scenario 2: The EdTech Startup**

A company wants to build an online learning platform that includes LevLang as one of its programming languages. They shouldn't need to:
- Make their entire platform open source (GPL would require this)
- Contact me for permission
- Pay licensing fees
- Navigate complex attribution requirements

**MIT License = They can build on it freely.**

**Scenario 3: The Student**

A 15-year-old wants to fork LevLang and add their own features. They shouldn't need to:
- Understand legal jargon
- Worry about violating licensing terms
- Ask permission to experiment
- Share their changes if they don't want to

**MIT License = They can learn by doing.**

## What the MIT License Means in Practice

### ✅ You CAN:

- Use LevLang for commercial projects
- Modify the source code however you want
- Distribute your modified version
- Keep your changes private (no obligation to share)
- Integrate LevLang into proprietary software
- Use it in educational materials (free or paid)
- Build a competing product based on LevLang
- Do literally anything else

### ⚠️ You MUST:

- Include the original copyright notice
- Include the MIT License text

### ❌ You CANNOT:

- Sue me if something breaks (no warranty)
- Remove the copyright notice

That's the entire deal. Simple.

## The Trade-offs

I'll be honest: there are downsides to MIT.

**Someone could take LevLang, improve it, and never contribute back.**  
*I'm okay with this.* If they build something better, students win either way.

**A company could make LevLang Pro™ and charge for it.**  
*I'm okay with this too.* Competition drives innovation, and the original LevLang remains free.

**My work could be used in ways I don't agree with.**  
*This is the price of freedom.* I'd rather have maximum accessibility than control.

## Why Open Source at All?

Some people asked: "Why not keep LevLang proprietary and monetize it?"

Because **the best educational tools should be free**.

Programming education has a gatekeeping problem. Expensive textbooks, paid courses, subscription-based platforms—all of these create barriers for students who can't afford them.

By making LevLang free and open source with the most permissive license possible, I'm saying:

> "If you want to learn game development, cost should never be a barrier."

## A Personal Note

I grew up learning to code from free resources—online tutorials, open-source projects, community forums. People shared their knowledge freely, asking nothing in return.

LevLang is my way of paying that forward.

If a student in a developing country uses LevLang to learn programming and goes on to create something amazing, I want zero barriers in their way. No licensing fees. No legal complexities. No permissions needed.

The MIT License embodies this philosophy perfectly.

## The MIT License Text

For reference, here's the actual license (it's only 11 lines!):

```

Notice how readable it is? Even a high school student can understand what it means.

## Final Thoughts

Choosing the MIT License was one of the easiest decisions I made with LevLang.

It aligns perfectly with the project's goal: **make game development accessible to everyone**.

If you build something with LevLang—whether it's a classroom project, a commercial product, or a personal experiment—you have my blessing. Go wild. Teach others. Make something amazing.

That's what open source is all about.
