// Geometry Dash Clone - Not Implemented

// A Geometry Dash-style game is not possible with the current version of LevLang.
// The language engine would need to be significantly upgraded with
// several complex features.

// Required features that are missing:
// 1. Side-Scrolling Camera: The engine is designed for a single, static screen, not a level that moves horizontally.
// 2. Platforming Physics: The engine does not have concepts of gravity or jumping for entities.
// 3. Pre-defined Level Maps: The current system is for dynamically spawning objects, not for building a precise, pre-designed level layout.
