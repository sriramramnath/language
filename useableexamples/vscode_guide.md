# Using the LevLang VS Code Extension

The LevLang VS Code extension enhances the development experience by providing rich language support directly in your editor.

## Features

### 1. Syntax Highlighting
The extension provides full syntax highlighting for LevLang v3 files (`.lvl`). It color-codes keywords, component names, properties, and values, making your code much easier to read and debug.

- **Keywords** (`component`, `entities`, `game`) are highlighted.
- **Strings** (like component names and property values) are colored.
- **Comments** (`// ...`) are distinguished from active code.

### 2. Bracket Matching
The editor will automatically highlight matching curly braces (`{ ... }`), helping you to avoid syntax errors from unclosed blocks.

### 3. Auto-Commenting
You can use the standard VS Code "Toggle Line Comment" command (usually `Cmd+/` or `Ctrl+/`) to quickly comment and uncomment lines of LevLang code.

## Installation
To use the extension, you would typically package the contents of the `vscode-levlang` directory and install it from within VS Code's extension panel.
