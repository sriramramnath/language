# LevLang – Game Development Made Simple

> _"Prototype arcade games in minutes, keep pygame-level control when you need it."_

## What is LevLang?
LevLang is a lightweight DSL that transpiles into clean Python/pygame. Author your game with high-level blocks (e.g., `player { ... }`, `enemy { ... }`) or switch to the advanced component syntax for full scene control. The CLI handles parsing, transpiling, and running so you can focus on gameplay.

## Why LevLang?
- **Easy to learn** – Human-friendly blocks that feel like describing a game aloud.
- **Simple syntax** – No boilerplate loops; defaults keep you moving.
- **Batteries included** – Input handling, collision helpers, UI overlays, and spawners.
- **Fast iteration** – `levlang watch` hot-reloads on save.
- **Game-focused** – Tailored for arcade, racing, shooter, and platform prototypes.
- **Cross-platform** – Runs wherever Python + pygame are available (macOS, Windows, Linux).

## Positioning
LevLang sits between visual builders and full engines. It’s expressive enough for bespoke mechanics, yet approachable for classrooms, jams, or rapid prototyping.
